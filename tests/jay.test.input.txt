Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter, author and visual artist.
Widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan has been a major figure in popular culture for more than 50 years.
Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when songs such as "Blowin' in the Wind" (1963) and "The Times They Are a-Changin'" (1964) became anthems for the civil rights and anti-war movements.
His lyrics during this period incorporated a range of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences, defied pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture.
Dylan made two important career moves in August 1962: he legally changed his name to Bob Dylan, and signed a management contract with Albert Grossman.
In June 1961, Dylan had signed an agreement with Roy Silver. In 1962, Grossman paid Silver 10,000 Dollars to become sole manager.
